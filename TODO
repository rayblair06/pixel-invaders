<!-- - ENEMY_ORBITER should bop around in a circular moment while moving down to avoid shots. -->
<!-- - ENEMY_SENTINEL should fire two shots. -->

- Descriptions to Upgrades
- Fix level-up balance to be more fun? Maybe have better upgrades first rather than just stat upgrades?
- Overhaul stats and fix previous runs
- Replace boss laser with sprites


Upgrade Ideas:
- Experience Boost
- Two shots

Bugs:
- required level for upgrade doesn't work, is off by 1?
- Firerate jitter isn't random enough
