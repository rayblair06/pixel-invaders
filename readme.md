## **Building from Source**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayblair06/PixelInvaders.git
cd PixelInvaders
```

### 2. Build with CMake

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Executables:

* **Linux/macOS:** `build/PixelInvaders` or inside `.app` bundle on macOS
* **Windows:** `build/PixelInvaders.exe`

---

## **Running the Game**

Make sure the `assets/` folder is in the same directory as the binary:

```bash
./PixelInvaders
```

---

## **Cross-Platform Builds**

GitHub Actions automatically builds and packages **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** releases.

For Windows manual builds, ensure SDL2 and its extensions are correctly linked or placed in your CMake paths.

---

## **Development Notes**

* Modularized C source: `player.c`, `enemies.c`, `bullets.c`, `waves.c`, `audio.c`, `ui.c`, `options.c`, etc.
* Enemy AI and movement patterns are type-driven (`Drone`, `Orbiter`, `Razor`, `Viper`, `Sentinel`).
* Unified shooting system with cooldowns + jitter supports spread shots, aimed shots, and twin cannons.
* Hitboxes are center-scaled for fairness (player and enemies have smaller-than-sprite hit areas).
* `options.c` manages resolution and fullscreen/window modes.
* `version.h` is generated at build with Git tag + build date.
