## **Dependencies**

PixelInvaders is built on **SDL2** and its common extensions:

* [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)
* [SDL2\_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image)
* [SDL2\_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf)
* [SDL2\_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer)

On Linux, you can install these via:

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

On macOS (via Homebrew):

```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer
```

On Windows, the GitHub Actions pipeline fetches precompiled SDL2 binaries automatically.

## **Development Notes**

* The project is modularized with separate files for **player**, **enemies**, **bullets**, **waves**, **audio**, and **UI**.
* Upgrades and game logic are defined in `upgrades.c`, `game.c`, and `waves.c`.
* `version.h` is auto-generated during builds with the Git tag and build date.
